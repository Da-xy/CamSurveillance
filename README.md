# camProject

It's a video surveillance project with a Raspberry Pi. Indeed, I use a webcam plugged in the Pi to capture the images. Then i treat
them with Processing 3 to find the movement. If the movement is enough (more than 20% of the total of pixels), I send an alarm sound.

Processing libraries used :
- Video (video capture)
- Sound (not supported by the Pi, gonna try with beads)
